# FinanceSimple

The app is a perfect platform to inspire teenagers and young adults to learn about finance and actually have the opportunity to apply financial knowledge in a virtual setting.

On the main page of the app there are well-designed lessons which guide you into the financial world. In each of the lessons, besides a video and text explaining the concepts, the user will also get the chance to work through a set of practice questions to enhance their understandings. By watching the videos and working through the problems, the user will be rewarded Finan Dollars, which act as the virtual currency in our platform. To add more fun and interactions to the study process, we've also created Kahoot competitions which every teenager loves! In addition, for those who are really ambitious, there is a challenge related to each lesson where the users need to think hard and apply hard in a more complex setting to earn addition Finan Dollars.

We know that working through video lessons can be boring and we know that the most significant part of learning finance is actually to be able to apply the concepts in real life. That's the idea behind how we come up with the second module, which is a virtual market. Considering the stock market might be too complex and overwhelming for a 10-year-old to start with, we decide to create a virtual barn market to trade grocery items. The prices vary every day and users will be able to use their Finan Dollars to buy and sell the items. This virtual market can let the users experience the usefulness of finance in real lives and help them develop the habit of applying financial knowledge to save and invest.

We notice that the environmental issue is also something that teenagers should be exposed to. So in our app, we allow users to plant trees using their Finan Dollars. In the future, we would be planting actual trees for the users! This functionality can remind people to act environmentally friendly in their daily lives.

There is also a profile page on the app where the users can modify their names, profile pictures, and see their Finan Dollars as well as local and global rankings.
